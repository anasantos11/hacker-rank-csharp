    /// Problem resolved:
    ///     Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small details like topography. 
    ///     During his last hike he took exactly n steps. For every step he took, he noted if it was an uphill, U , or a downhill, D step. 
    ///     Gary's hikes start and end at sea level and each step up or down represents a  unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:
    ///
    ///     * A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step 
    ///     down to sea level.
    ///     * A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step 
    ///     up to sea level.
    ///
    ///     Given Gary's sequence of up and down steps during his last hike, find and print the number of valleys he walked through.
    /// 
    ///     For example, if Gary's path is s=[DDUUUUDD], he first enters a valley 2 units deep. Then he climbs out an up onto a mountain 2 units 
    ///     high. Finally, he returns to sea level and ends his hike.
    /// Function Description
    ///     Complete the countingValleys function in the editor below.It must return an integer that denotes the number of valleys Gary traversed.
    ///     countingValleys has the following parameter(s):
    ///     n: the number of steps Gary takes
    ///     s: a string describing his path
    /// Input Format
    ///     The first line contains an integer, the number of steps in Gary's hike. 
    ///     The second line contains a single string , of characters that describe his path.
    /// Constraints
    ///     <code>
    ///         2 <= n <= 10 ^ 6
    ///         s[i] == U || s[i] == D
    ///     </code>
    /// Output Format
    ///     Print a single integer that denotes the number of valleys Gary walked through during his hike.
    /// Sample Input
    ///     8
    ///     UDDDUDUU
    /// Sample Output
    ///     1
